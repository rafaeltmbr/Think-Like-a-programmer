 * The goal here is to solve the problem with the techniques i've learned
 * during the reading.
 * <br><br>
 * 
 * <h3>Problem: Half of a square</h3>
 * <em>Write a program that uses only two output statements, cout << "#" and
 * cout << "\n", to produce a pattern of hash symbols shaped like half of a
 * perfect 5 Ã— 5 square (or a right triangle): </em><br>
 * <pre>

 * <h3>Problem: A sideways triangle</h3>
 * <em>Write a program that uses only two output statements, cout << "#" and
 * cout << "\n", to produce a pattern of hash symbols shaped like a sideways
 * triangle: </em><br>
